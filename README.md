# NatureHop

A therapeutic, nature based infinite runner game. 🌙 

Built on PC but it also has mobile VR compatibility! 🕶 Tested on my GearVR. 👓

Below are some sceenshots from using it on the mobile while using the VR headset, and a GIF walkthrough of a test on PC. 💻 

The aim is to keep jumping over the platforms for as long as possible, until you fall in the water, at which point you have to start again! 

Make sure you enjoy the views around you while you're hopping. 🌲🌱🌿✨ I love making beautiful environment designs which almost distract you from the game. 🍃

Just keep hoppin', just keep hopping... 🐰

It's still a little shabby, because I'm still learning. Not an expert (YET) This was super fun to build, though, and I learned a lot. 

Feedback is always appreciated 👏

Thanks to Wooga for this great opportunity 😍👾
